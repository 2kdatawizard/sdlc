## Cloud Migration

### Objective
Transition the bank's on-premises infrastructure to AWS, adopting cloud-native solutions and services to enhance scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency.

### High-Level Activities

#### Phase 1: Initial Cloud Setup and Migration
1. **Cloud Environment Setup**:
   - Establish foundational AWS infrastructure.
   - Configure network settings, security groups, and IAM roles.
   - Set up monitoring and logging with CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail.

2. **Migration Planning**:
   - Conduct a thorough inventory of on-premises resources.
   - Categorize applications and data for migration suitability.
   - Develop a migration strategy that minimizes downtime.

3. **Pilot Migration**:
   - Select a non-critical system for a pilot migration.
   - Test the migration process and refine strategies based on outcomes.
   - Document lessons learned and apply them to subsequent migrations.

4. **Data Migration**:
   - Implement data transfer using AWS Database Migration Service or similar tools.
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency during the transfer.
   - Validate data post-migration.

5. **Application Migration**:
   - Migrate applications using a suitable strategy (Rehost, Refactor, Rearchitect).
   - Update application configurations for cloud compatibility.
   - Conduct functional and performance testing.

#### Phase 2: Optimization and Modernization
1. **Cloud-Native Integration**:
   - Assess and integrate cloud-native services such as AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
   - Optimize applications to leverage auto-scaling and managed services.

2. **Decommissioning**:
   - Safely decommission legacy systems that have been migrated.
   - Ensure all dependencies are accounted for and redirected.

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Monitor and analyze cloud spending.
   - Implement cost-saving measures such as reserved instances and right-sizing.

4. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Ensure all cloud resources comply with industry regulations (e.g., PCIDSS, GDPR).
   - Implement a robust cloud security posture with AWS Shield, WAF, and other security services.

5. **Continuous Improvement and Training**:
   - Establish a Center of Excellence for cloud adoption within the bank.
   - Provide ongoing training and resources to staff for cloud best practices.
   - Set up a feedback loop for continuous process and performance improvement.

### Milestones
- Completion of cloud environment setup.
- Successful pilot migration.
- Full-scale application and data migration.
- Decommissioning of on-premises infrastructure.
- Optimization and modernization of cloud services.

### Dependencies
- Availability of AWS resources and services.
- Alignment with other project areas such as data strategy and security.
- Stakeholder buy-in and support for cloud initiatives.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Downtime during migration: Implement a phased migration approach with rollback plans.
- Data loss: Ensure robust backup and data validation processes.
- Cost overruns: Regularly monitor and adjust resource utilization.
