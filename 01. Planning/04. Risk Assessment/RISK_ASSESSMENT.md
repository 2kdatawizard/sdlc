# Risk Assessment

## Introduction

Risk Assessment is a critical component of the project planning phase where potential risks are identified, analyzed, and mitigation strategies are developed. This document outlines the process of identifying risks to the project's success and planning for risk management.

## Objective

The objective of this risk assessment is to proactively identify and address potential issues that could impact the project's timeline, performance, budget, and overall success.

## Risk Identification

List all identified risks along with their sources and potential impact on the project.

| ID | Risk Description | Category | Source | Potential Impact |
|----|------------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| R1 |                  |          |        |                  |
| R2 |                  |          |        |                  |

## Risk Analysis

Analyze the likelihood and impact of each risk to prioritize them.

| ID | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Priority (H/M/L) |
|----|------------------|--------------|------------------|
| R1 |                  |              |                  |
| R2 |                  |              |                  |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

Develop strategies to mitigate or manage each identified risk.

| ID | Mitigation Strategy | Responsible Person | Timeline |
|----|---------------------|--------------------|----------|
| R1 |                     |                    |          |
| R2 |                     |                    |          |

## Risk Monitoring and Control

Outline how risks will be monitored throughout the project lifecycle, who will be responsible, and how changes will be reported and managed.

## Risk Register

Maintain a live risk register document that will be updated as new risks are identified and as existing risks evolve.
