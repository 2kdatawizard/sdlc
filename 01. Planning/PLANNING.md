# Planning Phase of SDLC

The planning phase is the foundation of the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves outlining the project's objectives, scope, purpose, and deliverables, with the intention to set the groundwork for the entire project.

## Key Processes and Diagrams

This section will contain various documents and diagrams that are crucial during the planning stage of any software development project.

### Documents

- `Project_Charter.md` - A document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.
- `Feasibility_Study.md` - An analysis of the viability of an idea, which includes a preliminary evaluation of the problem and the benefits and costs of implementing the proposed solution.
- `Stakeholder_Analysis.md` - A process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.
- `Risk_Assessment.md` - A document outlining potential risks, their impact, and mitigation strategies to manage risk throughout the project lifecycle.
- `Requirements_Collection.md` - A comprehensive guide on collecting, articulating, and agreeing on the requirements of the project with stakeholders.

### Diagrams

- `Gantt_Chart.png` - A visual timeline that outlines the start and finish dates of the elements of a project.
- `Work_Breakdown_Structure.png` - A diagram that breaks down the project into smaller components to make it more manageable.
- `Network_Diagram.png` - A graphical representation of the project's activities and the sequences they follow.
- `Resource_Allocation_Chart.png` - A chart that helps in planning and allocating resources for different tasks of the project.
