# Design Phase

## Overview

This document outlines the design phase of the project, detailing the architectural decisions, design patterns, and frameworks that will be used. It serves as a guide for developers and stakeholders to understand the planned structure and behavior of the system.

## Architectural Strategy

### High-Level Architecture

- **System Architecture**: Describe the overall system architecture, including the major components and how they interact.
- **Technology Stack**: List the technologies, languages, and frameworks chosen for this project and the rationale behind these choices.

### Component Design

- **Modules**: Define the key modules of the application and their responsibilities.
- **Services**: Describe any external or internal services that the application will integrate with.

## User Interface Design

- **Wireframes**: Link to or embed the wireframes that illustrate the user interface and user experience.
- **Design System**: Outline the design system, including color schemes, typography, and UI components.

## Database Design

- **ER Diagrams**: Include Entity-Relationship diagrams to represent the data model.
- **Schema Definitions**: Provide detailed schema definitions for the database.

## API Design

- **API Endpoints**: List the API endpoints with their respective methods, request parameters, and response formats.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Explain the approach for API security, including authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Security Design

- **Compliance Standards**: Mention any compliance standards the design adheres to (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Data Protection**: Describe the measures taken to protect sensitive data.

## Scalability and Performance

- **Load Balancing**: Discuss the strategy for load balancing and distributing traffic.
- **Caching**: Outline caching strategies and technologies.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Logging**: Define the logging strategy and tools used.
- **Error Handling**: Describe the approach for handling and reporting errors.

## Design Patterns

- **Patterns Used**: Enumerate any design patterns employed in the system's design and the reasons for their use.

## Mockups and Prototypes

- **Prototypes**: Provide links to any interactive prototypes if available.
- **Feedback Loop**: Describe how feedback on designs will be collected and incorporated.

## Design Review

- **Review Process**: Outline the process for reviewing and approving the design documents.
- **Stakeholder Sign-off**: Include a section for stakeholders to sign off on the design phase.

## Appendices

- **Appendix A**: Any additional diagrams, charts, or relevant documents.
- **Appendix B**: Glossary of terms used in the design document.
